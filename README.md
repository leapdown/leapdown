Hi, I'm @leapdown. I am currently learning and working on scale, performance and utilies.
I am interested in all things tech and software in general with focus on performance and efficiency.

I am a bit reserved and skeptical about sharing personal information online, so you will not find my name or location on my bio/publicly.

You can reach out to me on twitter for projects/ideas or just to say hi/get to know each other better.
